1. Introduction and Setup

What is Django?

Django is a high-level web framework written in Python that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the MVT (Model-View-Template) structure and comes packed with built-in features for handling databases, templates, and routing.

Two reasons why Django is suitable for web development:

    Django provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), allowing developers to interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL.

    It comes with ready-to-use components like an admin interface, form system, URL management, and built-in security.

Steps to set up Django in a virtual environment:

    Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv myenv

Activate the environment (Linux/Mac):

    source myenv/bin/activate

2. Creating the Project

To start a new Django project named todolist, run:

django-admin startproject todolist

Navigate into the newly created project directory:

cd todolist

Now, create an app named tasks:

python manage.py startapp tasks

3. Models and Migrations

Inside tasks/models.py, define your model like this:

from django.db import models

class Task(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    completed = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

To create and apply migrations, use:

python manage.py makemigrations tasks
python manage.py migrate

4. Views, Templates, and Static Files

Create a view to show tasks:

In tasks/views.py:

from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Task

def home(request):
    tasks = Task.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'tasks': tasks})

Set up URLs:

In tasks/urls.py:

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]

Include the app’s URLs in todolist/urls.py:

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('tasks.urls')),
]

Create the template:

In tasks/templates/home.html:

{% load static %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Task List</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'style.css' %}">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Task List</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for task in tasks %}
            <li>
                {{ task.title }} -
                {% if task.completed %}
                    Done
                {% else %}
                    Pending
                {% endif %}
            </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>

Static files configuration:

    In settings.py, confirm this line is present:

STATIC_URL = '/static/'

    Inside the tasks app, create a folder named static.

    Then, inside that folder, make a file called style.css:

body {
    font-family: sans-serif;
    background-color: #eaeaea;
    padding: 20px;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
}

li {
    margin: 10px 0;
}

Remember to load the static files by placing {% load static %} at the top of the HTML template.
